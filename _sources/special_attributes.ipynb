    "# Special Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, all data types have a set of special attributes, commonly referred to as **dunder attributes**[^dunder].  \n",
    "These attributes provide developers with useful metadata about Python objects. They follow the naming pattern `__attribute__` — with two leading and two trailing underscores where `attribute` is the name of the given dunder attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python’s built-in objects come with many such attributes. Some external libraries also define their own custom dunder attributes, but this practice is generally discouraged unless it is truly necessary and thoroughly documented {cite}`python:lexical_identifiers`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will explore the most important core dunder attributes across different types of Python objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "[^dunder]: The term **dunder** comes from **d**ouble **under**score.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Of Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "### `__name__`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `__name__` attribute holds the name of a module.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} What is a Python module?\n",
    ":class: hint\n",
    "\n",
    "Not sure what a Python module is? According to the official Python tutorial, a module is simply  \n",
    "“[...] **a file** containing Python definitions and statements” {cite}`python:tutorial_modules`.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, the module name corresponds to the filename without the `.py` suffix {cite}`python:tutorial_modules`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the file `my_math.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# file my_math.py\n",
    "\n",
    "def multiply(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n",
    "  return a * b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if we import this module:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import my_math\n",
    "print(my_math.__name__)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The output will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "my_math\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**However**, there is a special case: the `__mame__` attribute takes the value: `__main__` when a module is executed directly {cite}`python:datamodel_specialnames`\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's modify `my_math.py` to display the value of `__name__`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# file my_math.py\n",
    "print(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "def multiply(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n",
    "  return a * b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If we now run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python3 my_math.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The output will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "__name__\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The same happens when you execute code passed as a string:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -c \"print(__name__)\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "__name__\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "````{admonition} Did you know?\n",
    ":class: hint\n",
    "\n",
    "Because `__name__` is set to `__main__` only when a file is executed directly, you will often see Python code guarded like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern allows developers to include logic that should only run on direct execution, while preventing it from running when the file is imported as a module.\n",
    "Let’s investigate with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-cell} python3\n",
    "# file: my_math.py\n",
    "\n",
    "def multiply(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n",
    "  return a * b\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    print(\"I'm executed directly!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now compare the two cases:\n",
    "- running `python my_math.py` will print `I'm executed directly!`\n",
    "- importing it inside a Python shell (or any module) with `import my_math` will print nothing\n",
    "````\n",

    "\n",
    "If you are already experienced in Python, you probably know that literally **all data** in the Python ecosystem are **objects** {cite}`python:datamodel`. This means that modules, functions, methods, and classes **are themselves objects**, not just instances of classes (that, by the way, are objects too).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, the \"Of Objects\" subsection covers the **core special attributes** that are fundamental to **all** Python objects. The previous subsections (Modules, Functions, Methods, Classes) describe **additional specialized attributes** specific to those object types. Therefore, objects of those types will have both the general object attributes listed here and their type-specific attributes described above.\n",
