    "# Special Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, all data types have a set of special attributes, commonly referred to as **dunder attributes**[^dunder].  \n",
    "These attributes provide developers with useful metadata about Python objects. They follow the naming pattern `__attribute__` — with two leading and two trailing underscores where `attribute` is the name of the given dunder attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python’s built-in objects come with many such attributes. Some external libraries also define their own custom dunder attributes, but this practice is generally discouraged unless it is truly necessary and thoroughly documented {cite}`python:lexical_identifiers`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will explore the most important core dunder attributes across different types of Python objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "[^dunder]: The term **dunder** comes from **d**ouble **under**score.\n",
