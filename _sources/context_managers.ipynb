    "As you are (hopefully) already accustomed to (at least basic) Python, you've almost certainly encountered those fancy and extremely useful structures with the {code}`with` keyword, called **context managers**. Where does this name come from? Well, context managers define a runtime environment (context) for a given block of code.\n",

    "I am sure you know it, but a block of code is a sequence of Python statements within the same indentation, e.g., this block of code for the `for` loop contains just a single statement: {code}`print(i)`:\n",

    "Why do we need such an environment? Well, when you need to configure anything before executing some piece of code (a code block) and/or tear down and clean up afterwards. That's the core idea behind **context managers**: set up before, clean up after, guaranteed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running in context\n",
    "To run code within the context managed by a **context manager**, we use the [`with`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-with-statement) statement. If the context manager returns any object on setup, you can bind it using the {code}`as` keyword:"
