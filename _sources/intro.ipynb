    "My name is **Jakub Walczak**, and I am an academic and artificial intelligence researcher.\n",
    "\n",
    "My journey in education began in 2019 when I started my doctorate, which I completed in 2022 after graduating from Lodz University of Technology. Since then, I have had the pleasure of teaching students Python fundamentals and delivering advanced courses on machine learning and data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parallel to my academic career, I have been active in the industry since 2016. This practical experience has been invaluable and includes roles such as:\n",
    "* **Software Developer** at Comarch in Poland\n",
    "* **Scientific Software Developer** at the CMCC Foundation in Italy\n",
    "* **Cloud System Developer** for AI Operations at OpenNebula Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "This blend of academic theory and real-world application has shaped my approach to teaching and is the foundation upon which this book is built.\n",
    "\n",
    "````{admonition} A Note from the Author\n",
    ":class: tip\n",
    "My goal is to help you move beyond basic Python knowledge and gain real control over your code. This book focuses on practical techniques, clever tricks, and deep insights that will transform how you approach development. These are the concepts that separate developers who *use* Python from those who truly *master* it. I hope this journey empowers you to write more elegant, efficient, and controlled code. Happy coding!\n",

Here's what you'll need to get the most out of your learning journey. Below, you can find what you should know before starting reading this book.\n",
